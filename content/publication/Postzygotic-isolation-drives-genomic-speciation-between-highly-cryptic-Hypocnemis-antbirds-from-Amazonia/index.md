abstract: "How species evolve reproductive isolation in the species‐rich Amazon basin is poorly understood in vertebrates. Here, we sequenced a reference genome and used a genome‐wide sample of SNPs to analyze a hybrid zone between two highly cryptic species of Hypocnemis warbling‐antbirds—the Rondonia warbling‐antbird (*H. ochrogyna*) and Spix's warbling‐antbird (*H. striata*)—in a headwater region of southern Amazonia. We found that both species commonly hybridize, producing F1s and a variety of backcrosses with each species but we detected only one F2‐like hybrid. Patterns of heterozygosity, hybrid index, and interchromosomal linkage disequilibrium in hybrid populations closely match expectations under strong postzygotic isolation. Hybrid zone width (15.4 km) was much narrower than expected (211 km) indicating strong selection against hybrids. A remarkably high degree of concordance in cline centers and widths across loci, and a lack of reduced interspecific Fst between populations close to versus far from the contact zone, suggest that genetic incompatibilities have rendered most of the genome immune to introgression. These results support intrinsic postzygotic isolation as a driver of speciation in a moderately young cryptic species pair from the Amazon and suggest that species richness of the Amazon may be grossly underestimated."
